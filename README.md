# Over time I hope to include tutorials to help Testers go from Zero to AI Hero. 

# The First Tutorial is how to use Python and matplotlib to visualize testing data. 
# I have included the Jupyter Notebook and testcasedata.csv to get you started, but hope you will use your own data after understanding the code.
