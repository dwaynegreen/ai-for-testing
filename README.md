## Tutorials to help Testers go from Zero to AI Hero. 

This is the full learning plan [Roadmap to AI for Testing](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/Road%20to%20AI%20and%20ML%20for%20Testing.md) Feel free to use this plan, or modify it for yourself. I have found it very useful to get me started and solve some interesting problems. 

Introduction to [Data Analytics for Test Cases](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/Data%20Analytics%20for%20Test%20Cases.ipynb) includes examples using Python and matplotlib to visualize testing data. 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/Data%20Analytics%20for%20Test%20Cases.ipynb) and [testcasedata](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/testcasedata.csv) to get you started, but hope you will use your own data after understanding the code.

[Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20Customer%20Feedback.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook on how to chart your customer feedback based on the textblob sentiment analysis algorithms. Also included some [sample user feedback]()https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/User%20Feedback.csv to get you started.
