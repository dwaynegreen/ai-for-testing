# ai-for-testing

## Over time I hope to include tutorials to help Testers go from Zero to AI Hero. 

A first tutorial on [Data Analytics for Test Cases](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/Test%20Case%20Analysis%20Status%20Over%20Time%20by%20Team.ipynb) includes examples using Python and matplotlib to visualize testing data. 
I have included the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/Test%20Case%20Analysis%20Status%20Over%20Time%20by%20Team.ipynb ") and [testcasedata](https://github.com/kevinpyles/ai-for-testing/blob/master/testcasedata.csv) to get you started, but hope you will use your own data after understanding the code.
